When decoding h264 stream on an ARM board from Texas Instruments with an AM62P SoC (https://www.ti.com/tool/PROCESSOR-SDK-AM62P), we see the following error:

```
DecodeComponent: Work with bitstreamId=105 not found, already abandoned?
```

This happens because `v4l2_codec2` associates each input (`OUTPUT`) buffer with a single output (`CAPTURE`) buffer using `bitstreamId`.

`bitstreamId` is passed to the kernel via the timestamp. This is the recommended way according to the v4l2 spec:

> To allow matching decoded CAPTURE buffers with OUTPUT buffers they originated from, the client can set the timestamp field of the v4l2_buffer struct when queuing an OUTPUT buffer. The CAPTURE buffer(s), which resulted from decoding that OUTPUT buffer will have their timestamp field set to the same value when dequeued

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/dev-decoder.html#decoding

By only allowing 1 output (`CAPTURE`) buffer per input (`OUTPUT`) buffer, the `v4l2_codec2` HAL violates the following v4l2 spec:

> The client must not assume any direct relationship between `CAPTURE` and `OUTPUT` buffers and any specific timing of buffers becoming available to dequeue. Specifically:
> * a buffer queued to `OUTPUT` may result in no buffers being produced on `CAPTURE` (e.g. if it does not contain encoded data, or if only metadata syntax structures are present in it),
> * a buffer queued to `OUTPUT` may result in more than one buffer produced on `CAPTURE` (if the encoded data contained more than one frame, or if returning a decoded frame allowed the decoder to return a frame that preceded it in decode, but succeeded it in the display order),
> * a buffer queued to `OUTPUT` may result in a buffer being produced on `CAPTURE` later into decode process, and/or after processing further OUTPUT buffers, or be returned out of order, e.g. if display reordering is used,
> * buffers may become available on the `CAPTURE` queue without additional buffers queued to `OUTPUT` (e.g. during drain or EOS), because of the `OUTPUT` buffers queued in the past whose decoding results are only available at later time, due to specifics of the decoding process.
See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/dev-decoder.html#decoding

Reworking the buffer tracking in `v4l2_codec2` might be a difficult task. Are there any plans to address this?

Hi Jiyong,

## 1. Without commenting out chown in VirtualizationService, 
I have modified in "android14/system/core/rootdir/init.rc"

```makefile

```

and "android14/packages/modules/Virtualization/apex/virtualizationservice.rc",  **"chown"** no longer reports an error.

### Question: **If our target is production, are such modifications acceptable?**  
----  
  

## 2. With such modifications above, a new issue has arisen.

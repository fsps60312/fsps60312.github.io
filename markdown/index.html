When decoding h264 stream on an ARM board from Texas Instruments with an AM62P SoC (https://www.ti.com/tool/PROCESSOR-SDK-AM62P), we see the following error:

```
DecodeComponent: Work with bitstreamId=105 not found, already abandoned?
```

This happens because `v4l2_codec2` associates each input (`OUTPUT`) buffer with a single output (`CAPTURE`) buffer using `bitstreamId`.

`bitstreamId` is passed to the kernel via the timestamp. This is the recommended way according to the v4l2 spec:

> To allow matching decoded CAPTURE buffers with OUTPUT buffers they originated from, the client can set the timestamp field of the v4l2_buffer struct when queuing an OUTPUT buffer. The CAPTURE buffer(s), which resulted from decoding that OUTPUT buffer will have their timestamp field set to the same value when dequeued

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/dev-decoder.html#decoding

By only allowing 1 output (`CAPTURE`) buffer per input (`OUTPUT`) buffer, the `v4l2_codec2` HAL violates the following v4l2 spec:

> The client must not assume any direct relationship between `CAPTURE` and `OUTPUT` buffers and any specific timing of buffers becoming available to dequeue. Specifically:
> * a buffer queued to `OUTPUT` may result in no buffers being produced on `CAPTURE` (e.g. if it does not contain encoded data, or if only metadata syntax structures are present in it),
> * a buffer queued to `OUTPUT` may result in more than one buffer produced on `CAPTURE` (if the encoded data contained more than one frame, or if returning a decoded frame allowed the decoder to return a frame that preceded it in decode, but succeeded it in the display order),
> * a buffer queued to `OUTPUT` may result in a buffer being produced on `CAPTURE` later into decode process, and/or after processing further OUTPUT buffers, or be returned out of order, e.g. if display reordering is used,
> * buffers may become available on the `CAPTURE` queue without additional buffers queued to `OUTPUT` (e.g. during drain or EOS), because of the `OUTPUT` buffers queued in the past whose decoding results are only available at later time, due to specifics of the decoding process.
See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/dev-decoder.html#decoding

Reworking the buffer tracking in `v4l2_codec2` might be a difficult task. Are there any plans to address this?

Hi Jiyong,

## 1. Without commenting out chown in VirtualizationService, 
I have modified in "android14/system/core/rootdir/init.rc"

```makefile

### Question: **If our target is production, are such modifications acceptable?**

### Bug description
The application has a single activity with a WebView in it. It shows an HTML page with a video in it, loading from an HLS stream.

After the manifest has loaded, the playback starts and the player shows the scrobbler sliding along and the correct remaining time of the video.

When testing the same HTML page in Chrome on the same emulator device the video plays back just fine. Below is a table of the emulators I've tried and the results.

### Observations
A warning/error that is printed a lot to the console during playback is

```
E/eglCodecCommon: glUtilsParamSize: unknow param 0x000085b5
```

It is printed for all of the versions that are failing, **but also** when running on API version 26 (which is working).

### Expected behavior
Since the videos are playing without problems on the stock browser for all the API versions above I did expect them to work inside the WebView as well.

Also, the stream working in version 26 and 28 and above, but not in version 27 which is weird. If the HLS support was in fact lacking, I would expect it to not load the manifest at all and not to start playback.

### Reproducing the bug
1. Download the isolated example from https://github.com/kbrabrand/android-webview-hls-bug
2. Open it in Android Studio 4
3. Run on a [physical or virtual] device
